* WHAT
  echoev is a simple TCP echo server, built on libev. It has several
  options; run 'echoev --help' for usage.

* WHY
  I wrote echoev to get some experience with libev.

* INSTALLING
  1. In the Makefile, uncomment the PLATFORM define for your platform.

  2. Set the INCLUDES and LIBS Makefile variables to point to your
     libev install, if it's in a non-standard location.

  3. make

* BUGS/LIMITATIONS
  - The server uses a per-connection ring buffer to prevent clients
    from DOSing the host (e.g., by writing an endless stream of bytes
    to the server without ever reading any of them back). The ring
    buffer capacity is 4095 bytes, so the client cannot have more than
    4095 bytes outstanding to be read from the server, nor can it
    write a single line greater than 4095 bytes. If the client exceeds
    its buffer size, the server will unceremoniously close the
    connection.
