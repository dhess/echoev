* WHAT
  echoev is a simple TCP echo server, built on libev.

* WHY
  I wrote echoev to get some experience with libev.

* INSTALLING
  1. In the Makefile, uncomment the PLATFORM define for your platform.
  2. Set the INCLUDES and LIBS Makefile variables to point to your
     libev install, if it's in a non-standard location.
  3. make
