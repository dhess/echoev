/*
 * A naive byte-addressable ring buffer FIFO implementation.
 *
 * The ring buffer's head pointer points to the starting location
 * where data should be written when copying data *into* the buffer
 * (e.g., with ringbuf_read). The ring buffer's tail pointer points to
 * the starting location where data should be read when copying data
 * *from* the buffer (e.g., with ringbuf_write).
 *
 * The ring buffer is full when the tail pointer is head + 1 (modulo
 * the buffer size).
 *
 * The code is written somewhat pedantically and contains many
 * assert()s to ensure that it's readable and correct. Feel free to
 * optimize the code for use in your own projects once you're
 * comfortable that it functions as intended.
